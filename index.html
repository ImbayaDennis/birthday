    <h1>Happy Birthday Love</h1><br>
    <p>It kinda sucks that day as special as this for someone as special as you has to be spent in a situation as sucky as this, but that doesn't mean it should suck! Wrote a little something here for you...it ain't that fancy but it's the least I could do at the moment but I hope you'll enjoy it!</p><br>
    <h2>The vessel</h2><br>
    <p>
        On the eve of this day, 22 years ago, the gods got together and decided that they would gift the universe with a beauty like none before. They were determined to make this their finest work yet, as though nature and all its glory that came before, was nay 
        enough to quench their burning desire to manifest beauty in a more refined form. They pondered and chattered among themselves, trying to figure out how they would finally lay to rest this unsettling need and as the moon reached its highest peak, a thought 
        came to one of them. He rose to his feet and silence followed. "I have reflected deeply, and from those depths, I have surfaced with a solution that will quench our thirst and quell the fire that has burned fron beneath us for millenia". The 
        silence peristed as his peers hang onto every word, as though their very existance depended on it. "Since times untold, we have gone through this cycle over and over again, each time creating something grander than the last. The universe is riddled with 
        wonders that makes obvious our presence and influence over its creation. And yet, it still isn't enough. Every few millenia we come together again after the majesty of the last creation has worn out and perpetuate the cycle by going even grander". He paused 
        for dramatic effect, knowing he had them wrapped around his finger. He started pacing from one end of the
        sky to the other, his heavy footsteps thundering through the lands and stirring up the wind. All the while, their eyes were on him. They could tell he was enjoying this moment but none dared to speak. Such was the way of the gods,
        whomever was able to come up with a solution to a problem at hand held all the power. And this was not just a 'some problem'. It was an unsettling itch that was yet to be scratched. "At that rate, we'll barely have space to stretch our legs and that is definately not acceptable. So this time
        instead of focusing on going bigger, why don't we take it all and focus it to one focal point". The silence that previously ensued was almost immediately replaced by an uproar. Roars of confusion, dissatisfaction and even hints of anger could be heard.
        "This is proposterous!","Go back to the depths of your reflections!","Has he even listened to himself?! At this rate we are doomed to burn to extinction!". The insults came flying from every direction but he still stood there, unphased and as confident as he
        was before. He lifted up a hand and the commotion settled as suddenly as it had started. He smilled, a small grin to himself, and spoke up again, "I know it may sound unorthodox, but here me out. The one and only time we scaled down, the results were not
        satisfactory and I'm fully aware of that. It brought upon the lands almost as much chaos and distraction as it did beauty but not nearly enough to compensate for the damage. But I'd argue that we gave up on that too soon, and that we could go even smaller. Smaller
        but in a more meaningful way. What if I told you that there was a way to scale down and scale up at the same time?" Now he really had them. The doubt, hopelesness and fury was now replaced by wonder. How was this possible...even for the gods? "Are you saying..."
        "That we could use the very creations that brought us shame and dissatisfaction to heal and enhance the beauty of everything that their hands have destroyed? That we could pour all this beauty into the soul of a mortal and that that mortal will influence every single
        mortal it would come into contact with to become a better version of themselves? That this mortals soul might rival the greatness of even us the gods? Probably. And I have already singled out a vessel I deam worthy enough to behold this beauty, It will 
        be born into this world before the moon peaks tomorrow". The silence resounded even greater than before. His slight grin grew into a full on smile as he knew they had taken the bait. "But, how will the lands be able to witness all that beauty if its hidden inside
        one flawed creature?", one asked as though to clear the final doubt in their mind. "If they won't be able to see it through this mortal's actions, or through the lives that this mortal touches, at the very least they'll be able to see it through the eyes,
        because the beauty will shine through and pierce through even the darkest and most rigid of hearts"
